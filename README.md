# Setup

## OPTIONAL: Creating a Bucket for this Tutorial

If you do not have an existing S3 bucket to use for this tutorial,
you can create one like this (you will need the [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)
set up first):

```
aws s3 mb s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
```
